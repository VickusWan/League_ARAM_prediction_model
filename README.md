# League_ARAM_prediction_model

League of Legends is team-based game where players form a team of five and assume the role of a champion, characters with unique abilities, generally varying around a type of class, and battle against another team of five players. ARAM (all random, all mid) is a game mode where the champions are randomly selected (rather than picked).

## Goal/Hypothesis

- Team kills
- Team deaths
- Total Damage Dealt
- Total Damage Taken
- Total Time CC'ed
- Total Gold Earned
- First turret
